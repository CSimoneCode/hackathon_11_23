# November 23 - 24 Hackathon!
## Topic: "Hindsight is 2020"
**The Prompt: 2020 has been a heck of a year. Looking back now, if you could do it all again, what app would you build that would help you best get through 2020?**
### Welcome to Hackathon
If you're not familiar with a Hackathon, the premise is simple: concept an app, build it, and form a presentation to "pitch" your app to a panel of judges. You will be working with UX Design Students to create an app that you can proudly present after only **1.5 days of work!**

### Requirements
* There's only one, from the technical-end: **This must be a React-App Front-End**

### How do we get started?
* Meet with your team and brainstorm ideas. Work quickly, but try to make sure your scope is reasonable! Include everyone in the discussion and try to come up with a project that your entire group is happy with. 
* Once you have your project scoped, reach out to your Instructional Associates (Nick or Milcah) and seek approval! While waiting, encourage your UX team to start working on wireframes, and begin discussing your programming strategy.
* Once you have approval, you are **good to go**. Whatever process you need to succeed, make it happen! 

### Presenting
* Your UX team will be working on making a presentation deck for your pitch. You as Engineers will be looking to demo your product after the deck has been presented. Remember: You want to pitch this product to the judges as if they were investors or shareholders!

### Final Notes:
You are the paragons of code wisdom in this format. Your UX designers will be looking to you for what is feasible in the time frame. With that in mind, know that your instructional staff is always available for support in the event that things go wildly awry.
